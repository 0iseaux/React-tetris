# React Tetris

## Basics

The tetris was built on **react.js**, following the [**tutorial / experiment of Thomas Weibenfalk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU), using react hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback` and custom hooks.

## Add-ons

A _Pause/ Resume / Try Again_ button was added.

A _score board_ using **node.js** and **SQL** is coming very soon.

## Credits

-   The font **Pixel LCD-7** was authored by [**Sizenko Alexander**](www.styleseven.com)
-   `useInterval.js` hook was created by Dan Abramov
